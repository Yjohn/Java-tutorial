### 1. Create a class name _Tree_ with 3 variables (remember naming conventions):
* tree height
* average tree height
* number of branches
* color

#### Which of the above should be static? Why or why not?

### 2. Create a Tree object in your main method and compare it to the average tree height - displaying a message about whether the tree is larger or smaller than average
