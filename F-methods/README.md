- Methods ~ http://www.learnjavaonline.org/en/Functions

Something to keep in mind is the _return type_ of the method. The return type is a part of defining the _method signature_.
If the method is not supposed to return any value, the keyword `void` is used. Otherwise, you will define your method with a preceding type. It could be `int`, `String`, `ArrayList<Integer>`, `Animal`, or any other type.

Ex: `public String getName() {` \
  'String' in this scenario shows that the method will return a value with the type String.
