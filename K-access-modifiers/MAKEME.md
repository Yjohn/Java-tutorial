# Homework

### 1. Create a class named Car defined with:
  - 4 private fields (make, model, year, and color)
  - A constructor method that takes 4 parameters and sets the values of the private fields listed above
  - Public getter and setter methods for all the private fields
  
  
### 2. Using the class created above, add a private method named 'isValidYear' defined with:
  - A boolean return value
  - One parameter called 'year'
  - Check if the year is greater than the value 1885 - and return true/false based off of this check
  - Call this 'isValidYear' method inside the setter for the 'year' field to make sure it is a legit year before assigning it to your field
  - Also call 'isValidYear in the constructor method to ensure the year value is valid
