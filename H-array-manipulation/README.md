### Arrays and ArrayList

### Methods attached to ArrayList class 
~ https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html
### Lists in Java
~ http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-collections/list.html

#### The ArrayList class resides in a package that needs to be imported into the project in order to be used. Imports are included at the top of a .java file and are defined by using the _import_ keyword followed by the package name of the class.
```
Ex: import java.util.ArrayList;
```

#### To initalize an object in Java (like ArrayList), you use the _new_ keyword along with calling the object's constructor method (more on objects & constructors later)
```
Ex: ArrayList<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
```
