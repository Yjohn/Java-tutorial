# Homework

### 1. Include the Car class (from the previous section) and create a new class named SportsCar that inherits from the Car class. 
  (if you didn't do the last section, just go to the access-modifiers section and grab the Car class from the solution.java)
  * Make sure you are inheriting from the Car class by using the `extends` keyword in the class signature
  * Within the SportsCar class, create 3 private variables named "topSpeed", "price", and "hasRacingStripes"
  * Include a constructor in this class that takes arguments for both the Car and SportsCar classes
  * Include getters and setters for your 3 member variables as well
  
  ### 2. In your Main class, create an instance of your SportsCar class
  * After creating the SportsCar instance, call the `setColor()` method to change the color to something else
  * Print the following values to the screen in your main method: color, topSpeed, price, and model
  * Notice that the SportsCar class inherits the public methods from the Car class
  * Notice if you try and call the `isValidYear()` method, it does not show up, because it was declared as a private method of the Car class


### 3. Look into some of these challenges:
This is a really good site for practicing/learning Java. All the challenges are good, but if you are looking for somewhere to start, try the _Java Inheritance 1_ challenge in the Object Oriented Programming category.
